Paper for 21-441 on Transcendental Numbers

Starting from the background information from 21441 and algebra, we will discuss transcendental numbers. Then, we will introduce methods of explicitly constructing, finding, and detecting transcendental numbers. We will talk about some addition algebra preliminaries and theorems from complex analysis. We will name several classes of transcendental numbers, and the specific methods of finding them will be discussed. The main theorems include the Lindemann-Weierstrass theorem, Gelfond-Schneider theorem, and Baker's theorem. Then, we conclude with a discussion of Schanuel's conjecture and its consequences. The main sequence of theorems is primarily related to determining the transcendence of complex numbers using auxiliary functions.
